# java-cli-bloop-sbt-postgres-tbl-function

## Description
Creates a small database table
called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.
Two new tables have been added, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.

Creates a new table `dog_expanded` that joins
`dog`, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`. Added clustered indexes on
`dog`.breedId and `dog`.colorId.

Turned `dog_expanded` into a view with an implicit index on `dog_expanded`.id.

Using table function with the aggregate function
COUNT, create a new view `breed_count`.

All output normally
seen in a terminal will be in `java-srv/log` which will dump to the screen. The project may seem to hang but the logs from the container must be written to the project this can take up to 3 min.

Compiled and ran from build server `bloop`.
